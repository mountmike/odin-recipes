    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds lamb shoulder, excess fat trimmed and diced into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, finely diced</li>  
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, finely chopped or grated</li>  
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>  
        <li>1 cup dry red wine (such as Chianti)</li>  
        <li>1 cup low-sodium beef stock</li>  
        <li>1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes</li>  
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>  
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>  
        <li>8–10 sprigs fresh thyme</li>  
        <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper, to season</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Brown the lamb shoulder:</strong> Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to a heavy-bottomed pot with a lid over medium-high heat (I use a 4-qt Dutch oven). Use paper towel to pat the lamb as dry as possible, then season generously with 1 teaspoon each kosher salt & ground black pepper. Add the seasoned lamb to the Dutch oven and cook until deeply browned on all sides, about 2-3 minutes per side. Work in batches as needed to avoid overcrowding the pot, which prevents browning. Transfer the lamb to a plate and set aside. At this point, preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the aromatics:</strong> Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pot & reduce the heat to medium. Once the oil is hot & shimmers, add in the onion, carrots, and celery, seasoning with 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the veggies are softened & deeply browned, 15-20 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, stirring to coat the veggies, and cook for 1-2 minutes more, caramelizing the tomato paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Deglaze:</strong> Slowly pour the red wine into the Dutch oven, using a wooden spoon to scrape up the browned bits that have formed at the bottom of the pot – that’s where all the flavor is! Let the red wine reduce by about half (this goes by quickly!), then pour in the beef stock, crushed tomatoes, and the herbs. I like to use kitchen twine to tie them into a little bundle for easy removal. Return the lamb to the Dutch oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Braise:</strong> Cover the Dutch oven and place it in the oven to braise for 2 – 2 ½ hours. When it’s ready, the lamb should shred very easily – it’ll be tender enough that you should be able to shred it right in the ragu by using the back of a wooden spoon. Remove the Dutch oven from the oven. Remove & discard the spent bay leaves & herbs. Shred the lamb & stir to combine. At this point, you can cool & store for later use (see Recipe Notes for storage & freezing instructions), or proceed with prepping lamb ragu pappardelle or gnocchi (below).</li>
        <li><strong>Boil the pasta:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the gnocchi or pasta to al dente according to package directions. Before draining, carefully dip a liquid measuring cup into the pot, reserving about 1 cup of the starchy pasta water & set aside. Carefully drain the pasta (or gnocchi) & set aside – do NOT rinse hot pasta/gnocchi!</li>
        <li><strong>Finish the Braised Lamb Ragu sauce:</strong> Meanwhile, as the pasta boils, bring the braised lamb ragu to a simmer. Stir in the heavy cream & grated parmesan. Reduce heat to low & continue to simmer, stirring occasionally as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Lamb ragu pasta:</strong> Add the al dente pasta or gnocchi to the simmering ragu sauce, tossing to coat such that the pasta is evenly coated in sauce. If the ragu is thick & needs to loosen up some, drizzle in some of the reserved starchy pasta water. If the pasta is loose & needs to thicken up some, sprinkle in some extra grated parm. Cook over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, until the pasta or gnocchi absorbs some of the ragu & the ragu clings to the pasta or gnocchi beautifully. </li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Portion the lamb ragu pasta into individual pasta bowls. Finish with some grated parm or finely chopped herbs as desired. Serve immediately. Enjoy!</li>
