    <h1>Sweet & Sour Pork</h1>
    
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A dish that takes me straight back to my childhood - Mom's Sweet and Sour Pork! Cubes of juicy pork loin are lightly dusted in rice flour & stir-fried with bell peppers, tomatoes, & onions in the most perfectly tangy & sweet homemade sweet and sour sauce. Made in 25 minutes or less with mostly pantry ingredients, this sweet n sour pork is a seriously quick & easy weeknight dinner - it's even faster than takeout!

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Season the pork:</strong> Place the pork in a medium bowl, seasoning all over with kosher salt. Sprinkle the rice flour over top, tossing to lightly coat the pork in the flour. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the sweet & sour sauce:</strong> Combine all listed ingredients in a medium bowl. Whisk to combine. Set aside, or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the vegetables:</strong> Add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot & shimmering, add in the bell pepper, onion, tomatoes, & garlic. Cook, stirring constantly until barely softened, about 1 minute. Carefully transfer vegetables to a large plate or bowl & set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown the pork:</strong> Return the skillet to medium-high heat. Add in the remaining olive oil. Once hot & shimmering, add in the pork, shaking off excess rice flour before adding it to the pan. Cook the pork until deeply browned, about 90 seconds per side.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish the sweet & sour pork:</strong>Pour the sweet & sour sauce into the skillet with the pork. Increase heat to high. Cook, stirring often, until the sweet & sour sauce thickens slightly, 2-3 minutes. Add the vegetables back into the pot. Stir to combine & cook until warmed through.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish the Braised Lamb Ragu sauce:</strong> Meanwhile, as the pasta boils, bring the braised lamb ragu to a simmer. Stir in the heavy cream & grated parmesan. Reduce heat to low & continue to simmer, stirring occasionally as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> immediately, spooned over white rice. Garnish with thinly sliced green onions as desired. Enjoy!</li>
