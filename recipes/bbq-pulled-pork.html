    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3–4 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 3–4 large pieces</li>
        <li>8–10 cloves garlic, sliced in half lengthwise</li>
        <li>12 ounces light beer of choice</li>  
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>  
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>  
        <li>1 cup dry red wine (such as Chianti)</li>  
        <li>1 cup low-sodium beef stock</li>  
        <li>1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes</li>  
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>  
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>  
        <li>8–10 sprigs fresh thyme</li>  
        <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper, to season</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep – Stud the pork with garlic & mix the BBQ dry rub:</strong> Using a sharp paring knife, carefully cut a few deep slits into each piece of pork shoulder, then insert sliced garlic into each pocket. Set aside. Add all listed BBQ dry rub ingredients to a small bowl or jar. Whisk or shake to combine. Set aside or store in an airtight container on your spice rack for up to 1 month.</li>
        <li><strong>Braise the BBQ pork:</strong> Season the pork with the BBQ dry rub & arrange the seasoned pork in a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven with a lid, sprinkling any excess BBQ dry rub over top. Add in all liquid ingredients – beer, soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, sesame oil, & liquid smoke. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low to maintain a steady simmer. Cover & simmer for 3-4 hours, until the BBQ pork is fall-apart tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish the BBQ pulled pork: </strong> Carefully transfer the pork to a plate or cutting board. Use tongs or 2 forks to shred the pork into bite-sized pieces. Serve your BBQ pulled pork immediately or cool & store for later use (see Recipe Notes for Serving Ideas, & Storage & Freezing guidance). Enjoy!</li>
